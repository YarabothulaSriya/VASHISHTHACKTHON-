This initiative changes the way people choose music by tailoring suggestions to each person's preferences, feelings, and environment. It takes the user's emotional state into consideration, prioritizing cheerful songs for happiness and peaceful instrumentals for studying, in contrast to general systems.
TITLE:
   DISPOSITION BASED MUSIC PROPOSAL FRAMEWORK
DESCRIPTION:
      A user's facial expressions might reveal their mood or emotional state. The camera on the device can be used to infer these expressions from the live stream. In the field of computer vision and machine learning (ML), a great deal of research is being done on teaching robots to recognize different human emotions or moods. Machine learning offers a number of methods for identifying human emotions. Our suggested approach creates a mood-based music player that makes song recommendations based on real-time mood recognition. This turns into an extra feature for the standard music player apps that are already pre-installed on our phones. Customer satisfaction is a key advantage of integrating mood detection. This system's goals are to analyze the user's image, forecast their facial expression, and recommend music that fits their identified mood.
