This initiative changes the way people choose music by tailoring suggestions to each person's preferences, feelings, and environment. It takes the user's emotional state into consideration, prioritizing cheerful songs for happiness and peaceful instrumentals for studying, in contrast to general systems.
TITLE:
      DISPOSITION BASED MUSIC PROPOSAL FRAMEWORK
DESCRIPTION:
      A user's facial expressions might reveal their mood or emotional state. The camera on the device can be used to infer these expressions from the live stream. In the field of computer vision and machine learning (ML), a great deal of research is being done on teaching robots to recognize different human emotions or moods. Machine learning offers a number of methods for identifying human emotions. Our suggested approach creates a mood-based music player that makes song recommendations based on real-time mood recognition. This turns into an extra feature for the standard music player apps that are already pre-installed on our phones. Customer satisfaction is a key advantage of integrating mood detection. This system's goals are to analyze the user's image, forecast their facial expression, and recommend music that fits their identified mood.The goal of the Disposition-based Music Proposal Framework project is to transform the way that music is selected and suggested for people according to their tastes, emotional state, and environment. Conventional music suggestion systems frequently depend on general criteria like artist, genre, or popularity, which might not necessarily be in line with the user's particular situation or emotional state at the time. By placing the user's emotional state front and center, this initiative aims to provide a more sophisticated and customized method of music suggestion. The concept entails creating algorithms and software that can assess your present state of mind or circumstance and then suggest suitable musical selections. It might determine your mood by analyzing things like your listening preferences in the past, your present activity level, or even information from wearable technology.For instance, it recommends lively music while you're feeling well or soothing instrumental music when you're studying.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
       The goal of the Disposition-Based Music Proposal Framework Project is to solve the problem of effectively creating music that meets particular thematic or emotional requirements. This framework simplifies the process of creating music by creating an organized method that bases its major input on the intended emotional or thematic disposition. By giving composers and creators a methodical approach to conceptualize and produce music that precisely aligns with the intended mood or theme, this creative solution addresses the issues of inconsistency and inefficiency in music production. This, in turn, improves the quality and relevance of musical compositions across a variety of applications and industries.

EXACT STEPS TO TEST THE PROJECT:
 1.We need to install all the required packages in both cmd and vscode
 2.After that we will get one url like( http://127.0.0.1:5000) because it is a development project
 3.We need to paste that url in chrome
 4.Then we will get the front cam to detect our emotion
 5.Based on that emotion we will get songs list
